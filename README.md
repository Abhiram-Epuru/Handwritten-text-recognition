# Handwritten-text-recognition
Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classifying handwritten text images. The project includes preprocessing techniques to handle noise and skewness in images, ensuring accurate predictions. It is simple, efficient, and suitable for small-scale handwriting datasets.
