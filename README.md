# Handwritten-text-recognition
Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classifying handwritten text images. The project includes preprocessing techniques to handle noise and skewness in images, ensuring accurate predictions. It is simple, efficient, and suitable for small-scale handwriting datasets.

# Features
Preprocessing pipeline for noise removal, grayscale conversion, and resizing images.
Efficient implementation of KNN for classification.
Supports small to medium-sized handwriting datasets.
Easily customizable for different handwriting styles or additional features.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

# Dataset
The model uses a dataset such as the MNIST dataset for handwritten digits or a custom dataset for specific characters.
Example Data Structure:
Training Set: Contains handwritten images with labeled outputs.
Test Set: Used to evaluate the accuracy of the KNN model.


# Challenges
Variability in handwriting styles.
Noise and distortions in scanned images.
Generalizing the model for unseen handwriting styles.
